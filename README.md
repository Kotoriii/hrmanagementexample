# Example Human Resources Management Software

This is a Web HR Management Software built on Java using NetBeans, Bootstrap and MySQL, imported from a private repo in Bitbucket for a small university project. It does very basic functions like sending a message to ask for a sick/vacation leave (which is a stub functionality), adding / managing employees and roles, etc. It features very basic Bootstrap styling and some dank memes as easter eggs.
